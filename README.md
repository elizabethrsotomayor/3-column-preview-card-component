## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I completed this project using CSS grid and flexbox. The first challenge was deciding between flex and grid to create the layout. I sketched out the layout and decided to use grid for the body and a flex container for all the cards. Each card was then given its own separate div with a base class of "card" and a respective class for each type of vehicle that could then be customized according to the specifications. I consulted the design multiple times so hope the width/padding is accurate. I had some trouble with getting the text to line up properly since it kept overflowing to the next line, so I used letter spacing to even things out.

### Continued development

I want to continue working with CSS grid and try making different layout patterns with it.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - An excellent resource for working with CSS grid that includes every property.
- [W3 Schools CSS border-bottom-left-radius](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-bottom-left-radius.asp) - This helped me understand changing the border radius on only one side of a div.
